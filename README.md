# Mango - Fastlane plugin

[![fastlane Plugin Badge](https://rawcdn.githack.com/fastlane/fastlane/master/fastlane/assets/plugin-badge.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/fastlane-plugin-mango)

A fastlane plugin that runs Android tasks on a specified [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image

Running Android tests, especially [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/) on a continuous integration environment like [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) can be a hassle. You need to boot, manage and destroy an [Android Virtual Device (AVD)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) during the test run. This is why we, the mobile releases team at [XING](https://www.xing.com), built this plugin. It spins up a specified [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image and runs a given task on it.

Another requirement we had was to run on a clean environment, which is why Mango also helps us to run our unit test and more. For an example check out the [example `Fastfile`](sample-android/fastlane/Fastfile)

## Prerequisites

In order to use this plugin you will need to to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on the machine you are using.
Documentation on how to set it up properly on a Linux (ubuntu) machine can be found [here](docs/docker-linux.md).

If you need an Android Virtual Device (AVD) to run your tests (for example Espresso, Calabash or Appium), it's necessary to check that your CPU supports kvm virtualisation. We already experienced, that it doesn't fully work on macOS and are using Linux for that.

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-mango`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin mango
```

## Usage

After installing this plugin you have access to one additional action (`mango`) in your `Fastfile`.

So a lane in your `Fastfile` could look similar to this:
```ruby
desc "Run espresso tests on docker images"
  lane :Espresso_Tests do |options|
     mango(
       container_name: "espresso_container",
       docker_image: "thyrlian/android-sdk:latest",
       container_timeout: 120,
       android_task: "./gradlew connectedAndroidTest",
       post_actions: "adb logcat -d > logcat.txt"          
     )
   end
```

Now you can call this new lane by calling `bundle exec fastlane Espresso_Tests`.

The Plugin will start up the given `docker_image`, execute the given `android_task` and afterwards execute the `post_actions`.

Of

## Configuration options
The `mango` action has plenty of options to configure it.

| Option | Description | Default value | Optional | Type |
| - |:-|-:| :-:| -:|
| `container_name`| Name of the docker container. Will be generated randomly if not defined. | - | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `no_vnc_port` | Port to redirect noVNC. To observe your docker container from your browser while it's running. | 6080 | ‚ùå | `Integer` |
| `device_name` | Name of the Android device. | Nexus 5X | ‚ùå | `String` |
| `emulator_name`| Name of the Android emulator. | emulator-5554 | ‚ùå | `String` |
| `docker_image` | Name of the Docker image, that should be started and used to run your tasks. | butomo1989/docker-android-x86-5.1.1 | ‚ùå | `String` |
| `container_timeout` | Timeout (in seconds) to get a healthy docker container. Depending on your `docker_image` it may take some time until it's started up and ready to use. | 450 (this equals 7.5 minutes) | ‚ùå | `Integer` |
| `android_task` | A generic Android task you want to execute. | - | ‚ùå | `String` |
| `sdk_path` | The path to your Android sdk directory. | `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `port_factor` | Base for calculating a unique port for noVNC. We recommend to use the `EXECUTOR_NUMBER` from your Jenkins environment. | - | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `workspace_dir` | Path to the workspace to execute commands. If you want to execute your `android_task` from a different directory you have to specify `workspace_dir`. | `/root/tests/` | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `maximal_run_time` | Defines the maximal time of your test run in minutes. This can be helpful if you want to kill hanging processes automatically after a certain time. | 60 | ‚úÖ | `Integer` |
| `bundle_install` | Defines if the Android task must execute `bundle install` before running a build. This is useful if you want to execute non-gradle tasks. Like [Calabash](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-android), where you need to update/install your [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) dependencies. | `true` | ‚úÖ | `Boolean` |
| `is_running_on_emulator` | Define if container boots up an emulator instance inside of it. This will trigger configuration of noVNC, assign necessary ports etc. | `true` | ‚úÖ | `Boolean` |
| `post_actions` | Actions that will be executed after the main command has been executed. | - | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `pre_action` | Actions that will be executed before the docker image gets pulled | - | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `docker_registry_login` | Command to authenticate yourself in a custom Docker registry | - | ‚úÖ | `String` |
| `pull_latest_image` | Defines if you want to pull the `:latest` tag of the given `docker_image` | `false` | ‚úÖ | `Boolean` |
